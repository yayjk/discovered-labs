The first exoplanet picture was from 2004. James Webb launched in 2021. You could literally Google this to check. The irony is brutal. The company that made Google couldn't fact check their own AI's first public answer.\n\nTwo days later they hold this big launch event in Paris. Hours before the event Reuters reports on the Bard error. Goes viral immediately.\n\nThat same day Google's stock tanks. Drops 9%. $100 billion gone. In one day. Because their AI chatbot got one fact wrong in a demo video. Next day it drops another 5%. Total loss over $160 billion in two days. Microsoft's stock went up 3% during this."
