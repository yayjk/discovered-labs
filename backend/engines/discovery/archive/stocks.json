I had bought last April and was hoping to hold 1 year to avoid short term capital gains, but sold recently because I felt the risk is too high to continue holding.\n\nWhile users have shifted from Google to ChatGPT, it did not impact GOOG's earnings because advertisers(GOOGLE's actual customers) continued to spend on Google- higher revenue per impression/click/conversion, as well as bot traffic from agents made up for drops in real traffic.\n\nBut Once OpenAI's ads program expands to all users(rather than just a test), tens of Billions of dollars that are spent on Google ads will be diverted to ChatGPT ads.\n\nGoogle has increasingly provided poor results for advertisers by providing misleading metrics, charging them for conversions that would've happened regardless of paid ads. For example, if you search for a product, often the company that sells the product is a sponsored result. Looking at their data, it looks like you can predict the cost per conversion, but in reality, you are paying for existing traffic. On top of this, because cost per conversion has been rising, advertisers are looking for alternatives that provide better ROI than Google search ads.\n\nOn top of this, Google's display ads via its adsense network is also taking a hit, as partner websites experience less traffic due to AI overviews and general use of LLMs.\n\nChatGPT ads offer a new way to pay for intent based traffic, and a way for businesses to diversify away from Google. This is likely the beginning of the end for Google.\n\nI believe GOOG faces the biggest threat because ChatGPT represents intent based advertising(Can display ads directly relevant to prompt/query), whereas other advertisers like Meta focus more on interest based advertising(displaying banner ads next to irrelevant content, that the user is expected to be interested in based on Machine learning))\n\nPositions: \n\n12/15/2028 $200 Put option",

If you keep reading mainstream media, r/stocks, and listening to Michael Burry, you'd believe it.\n\nYou'd be losing a lot of money though.\n\n**Real demand is through the roof:**\n\n* H100 prices recovering to highest in 8 months. This is a clear indicator that Burry's claim that old GPUs become useless faster than expected is wrong. Source mvcinvesting @ X. Can't post link here due to X being banned.\n\n* Burry\u2019s logic to short Nvidia is especially dumb. So he short Nvidia because he thinks old GPUs will be obsolete faster than expected because new Nvidia GPUs will be so much better. If companies all buy Nvidia\u2019s new GPUs, Nvidia wins. If no one buys Nvidia\u2019s new GPUs, then there is no faster than expected obsoletion. You can\u2019t have rapid obsoletion of old GPUs without buying a ton of new Nvidia GPUs. Do people not see the glaring issue? Burry\u2019s short reason is completely illogical. The only reason to short Nvidia is if you think demand for compute will fall. We\u2019re clearly not seeing this. \n\n* China's Alibaba Justin Lin just said they're severely constrained by inference demand. He said Tencent is the same. They simply do not have compute to meet user demand. They're having to use their precious compute for inference which does not leave enough to train new models to keep up with Americans. Their models are falling behind American ones for this reason. Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-10/china-ai-leaders-warn-of-widening-gap-with-us-after-1b-ipo-week\n\n* Google says they need to double compute every 6 months to meet demand. Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/google-must-double-ai-serving-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-demand.html\n\n* You can clearly see the accelerating AI demand from OpenAI\u2019s reported revenue numbers. OpenAI is already at $20b/year in revenue and without monetizing their free users. In 2024, their revenue grew by 2.5x. In 2025, their revenue grew by 4x. So it's not slowing down. If they grow 4x again in 2026, they're already at $100b/year in revenue. Sources: https://epoch.ai/data-insights/openai-revenue https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/sam-altman-says-openai-will-top-20-billion-annual-revenue-this-year.html\n\nNotice how compute is always followed by \"demand\". It's real demand. It's not a circular economy. It's truly real user demand. \n\nListen to people actually are close to AI demand. They're all saying they're compute constrained. Literally everyone does not have enough compute. Every software developer has experienced unreliable inference when using Anthropic's Claude models because Anthropic simply does not have enough compute to meet demand. \n\n**So why is demand increasing?**\n\n* Because contrary to popular belief on Reddit, AI is tremendously useful even at the current intelligence level. Every large company I know is building agents to increase productivity and efficiency. Every small company I know is using some form of AI whether it's ChatGPT or video gen or software that has added LLM support.\n\n* Models are getting smarter faster. It\u2019s not slowing down. It\u2019s accelerating. In the last 6 months, GPT5, Gemini 3, and Claude 4.5 have increased capabilities faster than expected. The intelligence graph is now exponential, not linear. Source 1: https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks Source 2: https://arcprize.org/leaderboard\n\n* There are reasons to believe that the next generation of foundational models from OpenAI and Anthropic will accelerate again. GPT5 and Claude 4.5 were still trained on H100 GPUs or H100-class chips. The next gen will be trained on Blackwell GPUs.\n\n* LLMs aren't just chat bots anymore. They're trading stocks, doing automated analysis, writing apps from scratch, solving previously unsolved math conjectures, and is already showing signs of self improvement (read what people in industry are saying last few months on self improvement). The token usage has exploded. If you think LLMs are still just used for chatting about cooking recipes or summarizing emails, you are truly missing the forest for the trees. \n\n* AI models are becoming so smart that they\u2019re starting to solve previously unsolved math problems. Here\u2019s Terence Tao, one of the smartest humans alive, explaining how GPT 5.2 solved an Erdos math problem: https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115855840223258103\n\n* There is a reason US productivity grew faster than expected in Q3 2025 and is accelerating. Productivity has grown the fastest since 2023 when Covid mostly ended. Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-08/us-productivity-picked-up-in-third-quarter-labor-costs-declined\n\nAt some point, the AI bubble will peak. Anyone who thought it peaked in 2025 is seriously going to regret it. When it does pop, it's still going to be bigger than it was in 2025. The world will not use less AI or require less compute than 2025. We're going to have exponential increase in AI demand.\n\nIf you\u2019re still skittish about investing in AI stocks, then just invest in S&amp;P500. All companies will benefit from AI productivity boost. Do not stay out of the market because you think the AI bubble will burst soon.\n\nStop listening to the mass media on AI. They\u2019re always anti-tech. Always. They were anti-tech before AI boom. They will be after. Negative stories get views and engagement. AI could find a cure for a disease but they'll write about how AI hallucinated that one time. Follow the people who are actually working on AI. \n\nI\u2019ll close with this: Railroad bubble in the US peaked at 6% of GDP spend. AI is at 1% right now.",

Source: &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/google-must-double-ai-serving-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-demand.html\"&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/google-must-double-ai-serving-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-demand.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can clearly see the accelerating AI demand from OpenAI\u2019s reported revenue numbers. OpenAI is already at $20b/year in revenue and without monetizing their free users. In 2024, their revenue grew by 2.5x. In 2025, their revenue grew by 4x. So it&amp;#39;s not slowing down. If they grow 4x again in 2026, they&amp;#39;re already at $100b/year in revenue. Sources: &lt;a href=\"https://epoch.ai/data-insights/openai-revenue\"&gt;https://epoch.ai/data-insights/openai-revenue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/sam-altman-says-openai-will-top-20-billion-annual-revenue-this-year.html\"&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/sam-altman-says-openai-will-top-20-billion-annual-revenue-this-year.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice how compute is always followed by &amp;quot;demand&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s real demand. It&amp;#39;s not a circular economy. It&amp;#39;s truly real user demand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Listen to people actually are close to AI demand. They&amp;#39;re all saying they&amp;#39;re compute constrained. Literally everyone does not have enough compute. Every software developer has experienced unreliable inference when using Anthropic&amp;#39;s Claude models because Anthropic simply does not have enough compute to meet demand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why is demand increasing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because contrary to popular belief on Reddit, AI is tremendously useful even at the current intelligence level. Every large company I know is building agents to increase productivity and efficiency. Every small company I know is using some form of AI whether it&amp;#39;s ChatGPT or video gen or software that has added LLM support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Models are getting smarter faster. It\u2019s not slowing down. It\u2019s accelerating. In the last 6 months, GPT5, Gemini 3, and Claude 4.5 have increased capabilities faster than expected. The intelligence graph is now exponential, not linear. Source 1: &lt;a href=\"https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks\"&gt;https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks&lt;/a&gt; Source 2: &lt;a href=\"https://arcprize.org/leaderboard\"&gt;https://arcprize.org/leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are reasons to believe that the next generation of foundational models from OpenAI and Anthropic will accelerate again. GPT5 and Claude 4.5 were still trained on H100 GPUs or H100-class chips. The next gen will be trained on Blackwell GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLMs aren&amp;#39;t just chat bots anymore. They&amp;#39;re trading stocks, doing automated analysis, writing apps from scratch, solving previously unsolved math conjectures, and is already showing signs of self improvement (read what people in industry are saying last few months on self improvement). The token usage has exploded. If you think LLMs are still just used for chatting about cooking recipes or summarizing emails, you are truly missing the forest for the trees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI models are becoming so smart that they\u2019re starting to solve previously unsolved math problems. Here\u2019s Terence Tao, one of the smartest humans alive, explaining how GPT 5.2 solved an Erdos math problem: &lt;a href=\"https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115855840223258103\"&gt;https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115855840223258103&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a reason US productivity grew faster than expected in Q3 2025 and is accelerating. Productivity has grown the fastest since 2023 when Covid mostly ended. Source: &lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-08/us-productivity-picked-up-in-third-quarter-labor-costs-declined\"&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-08/us-productivity-picked-up-in-third-quarter-labor-costs-declined&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point, the AI bubble will peak. Anyone who thought it peaked in 2025 is seriously going to regret it. When it does pop, it&amp;#39;s still going to be bigger than it was in 2025. The world will not use less AI or require less compute than 2025. We&amp;#39;re going to have exponential increase in AI demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re still skittish about investing in AI stocks, then just invest in S&amp;amp;P500. All companies will benefit from AI productivity boost. Do not stay out of the market because you think the AI bubble will burst soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop listening to the mass media on AI. They\u2019re always anti-tech. Always. They were anti-tech before AI boom. They will be after. Negative stories get views and engagement. AI could find a cure for a disease but they&amp;#39;ll write about how AI hallucinated that one time. Follow the people who are actually working on AI. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll close with this: Railroad bubble in the US peaked at 6% of GDP spend. AI is at 1% right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

But they're very different bets.\n\n**The quick comparison:**\n\n| Metric | NVDA | AMD |\n|--------|------|-----|\n| Forward P/E | 25x | ~42x |\n| Gross Margin | 75% | 54% |\n| Data Center Revenue | $51B/quarter | $4.3B/quarter |\n| AI Market Share | 80-90% | ~10% |\n| YTD Return | +39% | +99% |\n| RSI | ~33 (oversold) | ~39 (approaching) |\n\n**The case for NVDA:**\n\n- Dominant position (80-90% market share)\n- CUDA moat - developers are locked in\n- Forward P/E of 25x is actually reasonable for 50%+ growth\n- Better margins = more pricing power\n- RSI in oversold territory\n\n**The case for AMD:**\n\n- OpenAI partnership validates their chips for enterprise AI\n- Faster revenue growth\n- If they capture even 20% market share, stock doubles\n- Already outperformed NVDA 2.5x this year\n\n**The concerns:**\n\n- NVDA: Customer concentration, China export limits, competition catching up\n- AMD: ~40x adjusted P/E (GAAP inflated by Xilinx amortization) requires flawless execution, CUDA switching costs are real, still 10x smaller in data center revenue\n\n**My take:**\n\nAt current prices, NVDA looks like better risk/reward. You're paying 25x forward earnings for the dominant player during a technical pullback.\n\nAMD is a great company at a rich valuation. The OpenAI deal is huge, but ~40x adjusted P/E prices in a lot of optimism. I'd want a deeper pullback to $180-195 before getting aggressive.\n\nIf holding both: 70/30 NVDA/AMD makes sense.\n\nWhat's your take - is AMD's growth worth the premium, or is NVDA the safer bet here?",

Many avoid them because of talk about an \u201cAI bubble\u201d or because tech makes up a big part of the S&amp;P 500. They often compare it to the dot-com crash, but that\u2019s not the same in my opinion and there is why:\n\nBack then, companies were small, investors had little information, and rules were weak. Today, tech giants are global, highly regulated, and have multiple revenue streams. Microsoft earns from Azure and Windows, Amazon from cloud and logistics and these are not U.S-only businesses, they operate worldwide.\n\nSo why the fear? These companies are transparent and strong. If something big happens, tariffs or pandemics, it affects all sectors, not just tech. And now, every business uses technology. Microsoft today is nothing like [Pets.com](http://Pets.com) in 2000.\n\nSo why all of this fear on Tech ETFs? What else can be the leading theme next decades if every invention requires tech? War needs tech, Health needs tech.",

Many avoid them because of talk about an \u201cAI bubble\u201d or because tech makes up a big part of the S&amp;amp;P 500. They often compare it to the dot-com crash, but that\u2019s not the same in my opinion and there is why:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back then, companies were small, investors had little information, and rules were weak. Today, tech giants are global, highly regulated, and have multiple revenue streams. Microsoft earns from Azure and Windows, Amazon from cloud and logistics and these are not U.S-only businesses, they operate worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why the fear? These companies are transparent and strong. If something big happens, tariffs or pandemics, it affects all sectors, not just tech. And now, every business uses technology. Microsoft today is nothing like &lt;a href=\"http://Pets.com\"&gt;Pets.com&lt;/a&gt; in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why all of this fear on Tech ETFs? What else can be the leading theme next decades if every invention requires tech? War needs tech, Health needs tech.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

That would surpass the prior record set by the Saudi Aramco IPO in 2019.\n\nWall Street heavy hitters have already begun throwing their weight behind SpaceX as private investors. Baron Capital\u2019s Ron Baron said around a quarter of his personal investments are in the company. On top of that, SpaceX is one of the largest positions in the Baron Partners Fund. It\u2019s also the biggest holding in the ARK\u2019s Venture Fund run by Cathie Wood.\n\nSpaceX has shown leadership in the low-earth orbit, or LEO, market, according to Jefferies. SpaceX saw a quarterly record for LEO launches at 971 in the final three months of the year, an increase of more than 30% from the prior quarter and about 70% from a year ago, the bank found. The company launched more than 3,200 satellites in 2025, a new yearly record and increase of more than 60% from the prior year.\n\nAnalyst Kevin Lin told clients that SpaceX\u2019s launch volume is \u201caccelerating,\u201d while competitor Amazon.\u00a0Leo is \u201clagging\u201d despite entering a stable launch phase. Amazon said in November that businesses could test out its rebranded Leo product as it aimed to make up ground against Musk\u2019s Starlink.\n\nLin said he expects the total number of launches from across companies to hit all-time highs in the near future.\u00a0SpaceX\u2019s outlook is bright for another reason: data centers.\u00a0Technology moguls looking for ways to build out infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom are increasingly looking to firms like SpaceX that could put data centers in space, Lin said. Space data centers are expected to \u201cdrive\u201d the total addressable market for the LEO sector, the analyst added.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn response to the surge in demand for AI computing power and the Earth\u2019s energy bottleneck, the topic of space data centers has gained momentum,\u201d Lin told clients.\u00a0\n\nTo be sure, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said there are key problems that need to be worked out in order to effectively put data centers in space. However, Yu said he\u2019s \u201cencouraged\u201d by seeing companies such as Google and OpenAI also looking at how to do this. \u201cThere are clearly technical challenges to making this a viable endeavor but these seem to be engineering constraints as opposed to physics,\u201d Yu wrote to clients in a note last month.\u00a0\n\nA bumper SpaceX IPO could further drive up the wealth for Musk. His controversial $1 trillion pay package from his electric vehicle company Tesla\u00a0was approved by shareholders late last year.",

Here is the lowdown on why I'm loading up at\u00a0**$13.85**.\n\n# They still own the \"Cool\" part of Boston Dynamics\n\nHyundai gets all the headlines, but SoftBank still holds a\u00a0**20% stake**. At CES 2026, the new autonomous warehouse tech and the electric Atlas showed that these robots are finally ready for real-world work. If Boston Dynamics goes public, that 20% stake alone makes the current stock price look like a joke.\n\n# They have \"Skin in the Game\" everywhere\n\nThrough the Vision Fund, SoftBank has built an AI empire. They aren't just betting on one horse; they own the whole track. From the chips (ARM) to the brains (OpenAI) to the muscle (Robotics), they are exposed to every single layer of the AI stack.\n\n# The Price is a Steal\n\n$SFTBY is trading around\u00a0**$14**, down from its highs of $20+. While Tesla and Nvidia are priced for perfection, SoftBank is trading at a massive discount. It\u2019s an easy entry point for retail investors who missed the first AI boat.\n\n# They\u2019re back on \"Offense\"\n\nMasa Son (the CEO) recently signaled they are done playing defense. With their massive investment in OpenAI and new partnerships in AI energy infrastructure, they are positioning themselves to be the biggest winner of the \"AI re-rating\" this year.\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nIf you think robotics and AI are the next trillion-dollar themes, SoftBank is basically a giant Venture Capital fund you can buy on the cheap. The risk? It\u2019s volatile. The reward? Asymmetric as hell.\n\n**DYOR (Do Your Own Research), but I\u2019m adding small here.**",

Here is the lowdown on why I&amp;#39;m loading up at\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;$13.85&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;They still own the &amp;quot;Cool&amp;quot; part of Boston Dynamics&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hyundai gets all the headlines, but SoftBank still holds a\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;20% stake&lt;/strong&gt;. At CES 2026, the new autonomous warehouse tech and the electric Atlas showed that these robots are finally ready for real-world work. If Boston Dynamics goes public, that 20% stake alone makes the current stock price look like a joke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;They have &amp;quot;Skin in the Game&amp;quot; everywhere&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through the Vision Fund, SoftBank has built an AI empire. They aren&amp;#39;t just betting on one horse; they own the whole track. From the chips (ARM) to the brains (OpenAI) to the muscle (Robotics), they are exposed to every single layer of the AI stack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Price is a Steal&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$SFTBY is trading around\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;$14&lt;/strong&gt;, down from its highs of $20+. While Tesla and Nvidia are priced for perfection, SoftBank is trading at a massive discount. It\u2019s an easy entry point for retail investors who missed the first AI boat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;They\u2019re back on &amp;quot;Offense&amp;quot;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Masa Son (the CEO) recently signaled they are done playing defense. With their massive investment in OpenAI and new partnerships in AI energy infrastructure, they are positioning themselves to be the biggest winner of the &amp;quot;AI re-rating&amp;quot; this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think robotics and AI are the next trillion-dollar themes, SoftBank is basically a giant Venture Capital fund you can buy on the cheap. The risk? It\u2019s volatile. The reward? Asymmetric as hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DYOR (Do Your Own Research), but I\u2019m adding small here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
