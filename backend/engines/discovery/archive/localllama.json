You want to **use an existing vector index built with one embedding model and query it with another** \\- if it's expensive or problematic to re-embed your entire corpus, this is the package for you.\n2. You can also **operate mixed vector indexes** and map to the embedding space that works best for different questions.\n3. You can **save cost on questions that are easily adapted**, \"What's the nearest restaurant that has a Hamburger?\" no need to pay for an expensive cloud provider, or wait to perform an unnecessary network hop, embed locally on the device with an embedding adapter and return results instantly.\n\nIt also lets you experiment with provider embeddings you may not have access to.\u00a0 By using the adapters on some queries and examples, you can compare how different embedding models behave relative to one another and get an early signal on what might work for your data before committing to a provider.\n\nThis makes it practical to:  \n\\- **sample providers you don't have direct access to**  \n\\- **migrate or experiment with embedding models gradually** instead of re-embedding everything at once,  \n\\- ***evaluate multiple providers side by side*** in a consistent retrieval setup,  \n\\- ***handle provider outages or rate limits*** without breaking retrieval,  \n\\- ***run RAG in air-gapped or restricted environments*** with no outbound embedding calls,  \n\\- ***keep a stable \u201ccanonical\u201d embedding space*** while changing what runs at the edge.\n\nThe adapters aren't perfect clones of the provider spaces but they are pretty close, for in domain queries the minilm to openai adapter recovered 98% of the openai embedding and dramatically outperforms minilm -&gt; minilm RAG setups\n\nIt's still early\u00a0in this project. I\u2019m actively expanding the set of supported adapter pairs, adding domain-specialized adapters, expanding the training sets, stream lining the\u00a0models and improving evaluation and quality tooling.\n\nI\u2019d love feedback from anyone who might be interested in using this:  \n*- What data would you like to see these adapters trained on?*  \n*- What domains would be most helpful to target?*  \n*- Which model pairs would you like me\u00a0to add next?*  \n*- How could\u00a0I make this more useful for you to use?*\n\nSo far the\u00a0library supports:  \n*minilm &lt;-&gt; openai*\u00a0  \n*openai &lt;-&gt; gemini*  \n*e5 &lt;-&gt; minilm*  \n*e5 &lt;-&gt; openai*  \n*e5 &lt;-&gt; gemini*  \n*minilm &lt;-&gt; gemini*\n\nHappy to answer questions and if anyone has any ideas please let me know.  \nI could use any support you can give, especially if anyone wants to chip in to help cover the training cost.\n\nPlease upvote if you can, thanks!",

Preliminary internal benchmark tests conducted by DeepSeek employees indicate the model outperforms existing mainstream models in code generation, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude and the OpenAI GPT family.\n\nThe sources said the V4 model achieves a technical breakthrough in handling and parsing very long code prompts, a significant practical advantage for engineers working on complex software projects. They also said the model\u2019s ability to understand data patterns across the full training pipeline has been improved and that no degradation in performance has been observed.\n\nOne of the insiders said users may find that V4\u2019s outputs are more logically rigorous and clear, a trait that indicates the model has stronger reasoning ability and will be much more reliable when performing complex tasks.\n\n[https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deepseek-release-next-flagship-ai-model-strong-coding-ability](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deepseek-release-next-flagship-ai-model-strong-coding-ability)",

Preliminary internal benchmark tests conducted by DeepSeek employees indicate the model outperforms existing mainstream models in code generation, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude and the OpenAI GPT family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sources said the V4 model achieves a technical breakthrough in handling and parsing very long code prompts, a significant practical advantage for engineers working on complex software projects. They also said the model\u2019s ability to understand data patterns across the full training pipeline has been improved and that no degradation in performance has been observed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the insiders said users may find that V4\u2019s outputs are more logically rigorous and clear, a trait that indicates the model has stronger reasoning ability and will be much more reliable when performing complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deepseek-release-next-flagship-ai-model-strong-coding-ability\"&gt;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deepseek-release-next-flagship-ai-model-strong-coding-ability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The TLDR is that everyone is scrambling to buy as much as they can as soon as they can, because \"demanding a 50-60% increase in server DRAM supply prices from the previous quarter during their first-quarter negotiations with customers\".\n\nPer the article, DDR4 prices went up from $1.40 last January to $9.30 in December (my interpretation is $/GB). If they're increasing by another 50%, that's almost $14/GB!!! So, 1TB of DDR4-3200 will cost north of $14k by Q2 if this is true \ud83e\udd2f\n\nIn case anyone thought things weren't already bad, it's going to get much much worse this year.\n\nHere's the full Google translate of the article:\n\nDRAM, a type of memory semiconductor, was the key driver behind Samsung Electronics' first-quarter operating profit surpassing 20 trillion won. DRAM products, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM), are a core component of the computing infrastructure supporting the artificial intelligence (AI) era. The semiconductor industry predicts that the DRAM shortage, which began in earnest in the second half of last year, will continue until the end of this year, with prices also expected to continue rising.\n\nSamsung Electronics and SK Hynix, major suppliers of DRAM, are reportedly demanding a 50-60% increase in server DRAM supply prices from the previous quarter during their first-quarter negotiations with customers. A semiconductor industry insider reported, \"Even with significantly higher prices, the prevailing sentiment is 'let's buy as much as we can before it gets more expensive.'\" Recently, semiconductor purchasing managers from Silicon Valley tech companies, nicknamed \"DRAM Beggars,\" have been reportedly competing fiercely to secure remaining DRAM inventory at hotels in the Pangyo and Pyeongtaek areas.\n\nThe semiconductor industry analyzes that \"the demand that was initially focused on HBM in the early days of the AI \u200b\u200bcraze is now spreading to server DRAM, creating an unprecedented semiconductor boom.\" DRAM is a semiconductor that manages a computer's \"short-term memory.\" It stores and quickly transmits necessary data when the central processing unit (CPU), the brain, performs tasks. HBM is specialized for seamlessly delivering the massive data required for AI by increasing the data transmission path (bandwidth) dozens of times compared to conventional DRAM. However, HBM is extremely expensive and has limitations in increasing capacity. This explains why big tech companies are scrambling to secure server DRAM products to store more data.\n\nThe average contract price of DRAM soared from $1.40 (based on 8GB DDR4) in January last year to $9.30 in December. This marks the first time in seven years and four months that DRAM prices have surpassed the $9 threshold. Kim Dong-won, head of the research center at KB Securities, said, \"Due to this price increase, the operating profit margin (the ratio of operating profit to sales) of some general-purpose memories (widely used standard memories) is expected to reach 70%, and DDR5 may even surpass the margin of HBM3E. This year, semiconductor companies' performance is expected to be determined by general-purpose memories.\"\n\n",

A semiconductor industry insider reported, &amp;quot;Even with significantly higher prices, the prevailing sentiment is &amp;#39;let&amp;#39;s buy as much as we can before it gets more expensive.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; Recently, semiconductor purchasing managers from Silicon Valley tech companies, nicknamed &amp;quot;DRAM Beggars,&amp;quot; have been reportedly competing fiercely to secure remaining DRAM inventory at hotels in the Pangyo and Pyeongtaek areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor industry analyzes that &amp;quot;the demand that was initially focused on HBM in the early days of the AI \u200b\u200bcraze is now spreading to server DRAM, creating an unprecedented semiconductor boom.&amp;quot; DRAM is a semiconductor that manages a computer&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;short-term memory.&amp;quot; It stores and quickly transmits necessary data when the central processing unit (CPU), the brain, performs tasks. HBM is specialized for seamlessly delivering the massive data required for AI by increasing the data transmission path (bandwidth) dozens of times compared to conventional DRAM. However, HBM is extremely expensive and has limitations in increasing capacity. This explains why big tech companies are scrambling to secure server DRAM products to store more data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The average contract price of DRAM soared from $1.40 (based on 8GB DDR4) in January last year to $9.30 in December. This marks the first time in seven years and four months that DRAM prices have surpassed the $9 threshold. Kim Dong-won, head of the research center at KB Securities, said, &amp;quot;Due to this price increase, the operating profit margin (the ratio of operating profit to sales) of some general-purpose memories (widely used standard memories) is expected to reach 70%, and DDR5 may even surpass the margin of HBM3E. This year, semiconductor companies&amp;#39; performance is expected to be determined by general-purpose memories.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Come say hi if you like the project :)\n\n# Strix Halo Survey\n\nAMD leadership wants to know what you think of Strix Halo (aka Ryzen AI MAX 395). The specific questions are as follows, but please give any feedback you like as well!\n\n1. If you own a Strix Halo:\n   1. What do you enjoy doing with it?\n   2. What do you want to do, but is too difficult or impossible today?\n2. If you're considering buying a Strix Halo: what software and/or content do you need to see from AMD?\n\n(I've been tracking/reporting feedback from my own posts and others' posts all year, and feel I have a good sense, but it's useful to get people's thoughts in this one place in a semi-official way)  \nedit: formatting\n\nedit 2: Shared the survey results from the first 24 hours in a comment.",

Instead of generating single responses, it explores entire conversation trees to find dialogue strategies and prunes bad paths. I built it to help get better research directions for projects, but it can be used for anything\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shr3e0liv1cg1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eec800c6dcd9f1a4fd033d003fe80e102cba8079\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS](https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS)\n\nMotivation: I like MCTS :3 and I originally wanted to make this a dataset-creation agent, but this is what it evolved into on its own. Basically:DTS runs parallel beam search over conversation branches. You give it a goal and opening message, and it:\n\n(Note: this isnt mcts. It's parallel beam search. UCB1 is too wild with llms for me)\n\n1. Generates N diverse strategies\n2. Forks each into user intent variants - skeptical, cooperative, confused, resistant (if enabled, or defaults to engaged + probing)\n3. Rolls out full multi-turn conversations down each branch\n4. Has 3 independent LLM judges score each trajectory, takes the median\n5. Prunes branches below threshold, backpropagates scores\n6. Repeats for however many rounds you configure\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zkii0idvv1cg1.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=905f9787a8b7c7bfafcc599e95a3b73005c331b4\n\nThree judges with median voting helps a lot with the LLM-as-judge variance problem from CAE. Still not grounded in anything real, but outlier scores get filtered. Research context helps but the scroing is still stochastic. I tried a rubric based approach but it was trash.\n\nMain additions over CAE:\n\n* user intent forking (strategies get stress-tested against different personas)\n* deep research integration via GPT-Researcher for domain context\n* proper visualization with conversation playback\n\nOnly supports openai compatible endpoints atm - works with whatever models you have access to there. It's token-hungry though, a full run can hit 300+ LLM calls depending on config. If running locally, disable parallel calls\n\nIt's open source (Apache 2.0) and I'm happy to take contributions if anyone wants to help out. Just a project.\n\n\\--\n\nBTW: Backend was done mostly by me as the planner/sys designer, etc + Claude Code for implementation/refactoring. Frontend was purely vibe coded. Sorry if the code is trash.",

Instead of generating single responses, it explores entire conversation trees to find dialogue strategies and prunes bad paths. I built it to help get better research directions for projects, but it can be used for anything&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/shr3e0liv1cg1.png?width=2560&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eec800c6dcd9f1a4fd033d003fe80e102cba8079\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/shr3e0liv1cg1.png?width=2560&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eec800c6dcd9f1a4fd033d003fe80e102cba8079&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Github: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS\"&gt;https://github.com/MVPandey/DTS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Motivation: I like MCTS :3 and I originally wanted to make this a dataset-creation agent, but this is what it evolved into on its own. Basically:DTS runs parallel beam search over conversation branches. You give it a goal and opening message, and it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Note: this isnt mcts. It&amp;#39;s parallel beam search. UCB1 is too wild with llms for me)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generates N diverse strategies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Forks each into user intent variants - skeptical, cooperative, confused, resistant (if enabled, or defaults to engaged + probing)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rolls out full multi-turn conversations down each branch&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Has 3 independent LLM judges score each trajectory, takes the median&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prunes branches below threshold, backpropagates scores&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Repeats for however many rounds you configure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/zkii0idvv1cg1.png?width=762&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=905f9787a8b7c7bfafcc599e95a3b73005c331b4\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/zkii0idvv1cg1.png?width=762&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=905f9787a8b7c7bfafcc599e95a3b73005c331b4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three judges with median voting helps a lot with the LLM-as-judge variance problem from CAE. Still not grounded in anything real, but outlier scores get filtered. Research context helps but the scroing is still stochastic. I tried a rubric based approach but it was trash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Main additions over CAE:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;user intent forking (strategies get stress-tested against different personas)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;deep research integration via GPT-Researcher for domain context&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;proper visualization with conversation playback&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only supports openai compatible endpoints atm - works with whatever models you have access to there. It&amp;#39;s token-hungry though, a full run can hit 300+ LLM calls depending on config. If running locally, disable parallel calls&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s open source (Apache 2.0) and I&amp;#39;m happy to take contributions if anyone wants to help out. Just a project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BTW: Backend was done mostly by me as the planner/sys designer, etc + Claude Code for implementation/refactoring. Frontend was purely vibe coded. Sorry if the code is trash.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Let me take you back to the most notable things happened here during this time. This isn't really a list of model releases or papers, rather posts that were discussed and upvoted by the people here. So notable things missing is also an indication of what was going on. From the rise of Chinese open-source dominance to the hardware hacks, here is what happened in r/LocalLLaMA in 2025.\n\nThe year started with a splash. The [arrival of \"The Whale\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ho27fr/the_whale_has_landed/) (2121 upvotes, by u/fourDnet) marked the release of DeepSeek V3, setting the tone for what would become the \"Year of the Open Source Strike Back.\" It wasn't long before we saw [Sam Altman taking veiled shots](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1hphlz7/sam_altman_is_taking_veiled_shots_at_deepseek_and/) (1959 upvotes) at the new competition, a clear sign that the market was changing.\n\nWe were all trying to figure out how to run these new beasts. Nvidia teased us with the [Digits personal AI supercomputer](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1hvj4wn/nvidia_announces_3000_personal_ai_supercomputer/) (1663 upvotes, by u/DubiousLLM), while others were just trying to understand the sheer scale of what was happening. The realization that [DeepSeek was essentially a side project](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i80cwf/deepseek_is_a_side_project/) (2861 upvotes, by u/ParsaKhaz) for a hedge fund only made it even more interesting.\n\nBy late January, the narrative was clear: [Meta was panicked](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i88g4y/meta_panicked_by_deepseek/) (2779 upvotes, by u/Optimal_Hamster5789), reportedly [scrambling \"war rooms\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ibk9us/meta_is_reportedly_scrambling_multiple_war_rooms/) (2117 upvotes, by u/FullstackSensei) to catch up. The community was buzzing with benchmarks, with u/kyazoglu [testing almost every model that fits in 24GB VRAM](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i8tx5z/i_benchmarked_almost_every_model_that_can_fit_in/) (1861 upvotes) - a hero's work for the GPU-poor among us.\n\nThe \"DeepSeek effect\" was everywhere. u/Porespellar summed it up perfectly: [\"All DeepSeek, all the time\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iji47x/all_deepseek_all_the_time/) (4116 upvotes). But it wasn't just about models; it was about what we could *do* with them. We saw inspiring projects like u/Dry_Steak30's [open source tool to find their autoimmune disease](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ij5yf2/how_i_built_an_open_source_ai_tool_to_find_my/) (2488 upvotes), proving that local AI is more than just a hobby.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be 2025 without some drama. The threat of [20 years in jail for downloading Chinese models](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1igc6r0/20_yrs_in_jail_or_1_million_for_downloading/) (2092 upvotes, by u/segmond) worried us, but that didn't stop the innovation. We laughed when [Grok's think mode leaked its system prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iwb5nu/groks_think_mode_leaks_system_prompt/) (6465 upvotes, by u/onil_gova), and cheered when DeepSeek announced they would [open-source 5 repos](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iui6nk/starting_next_week_deepseek_will_opensource_5/) (4560 upvotes, by u/Nunki08).\n\nHardware remained a constant obsession. We drooled over [Framework's new Ryzen Max desktop](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iy2t7c/frameworks_new_ryzen_max_desktop_with_128gb/) (2004 upvotes, by u/sobe3249) and marveled at the monstrosity that was [16x 3090s](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1j67bxt/16x_3090s_its_alive/) (1797 upvotes, by u/Conscious_Cut_6144). \"It's alive!\" indeed.\n\nSpring brought the highly anticipated Llama 4. Mark Zuckerberg [presented the models](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jsampe/mark_presenting_four_llama_4_models_even_a_2/) (2645 upvotes, by u/LarDark), but the community felt it [fell short](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jt7hlc/metas_llama_4_fell_short/) (2175 upvotes, by u/Rare-Site). The community was let down, especially when compared to the relentless release schedule from the East.\n\nOpen Weight releases continued, though, we got [DeepCoder](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1juni3t/deepcoder_a_fully_opensource_14b_coder_at_o3mini/) (1609 upvotes, by u/TKGaming_11) and saw [DeepSeek open-sourcing their inference engine](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jytw62/deepseek_is_about_to_opensource_their_inference/) (1760 upvotes, by u/Dr_Karminski). There was also a moment of collective frustration when [llama.cpp was snubbed](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jzocoo/finally_someone_noticed_this_unfair_situation/) (1742 upvotes, by u/nekofneko) in favor of shinier wrappers.\n\nThen came [Qwen 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ka6mic/qwen_3/) (1940 upvotes, by u/ResearchCrafty1804). The excitement was back. We were running [real-time webcam demos with SmolVLM](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1klx9q2/realtime_webcam_demo_with_smolvlm_using_llamacpp/) (2762 upvotes, by u/dionisioalcaraz) and building [fully local voice AIs](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ktx15j/guys_i_managed_to_build_a_100_fully_local_voice/) (2447 upvotes, by u/RoyalCities).\n\nThe reality of our hardware addiction hit hard with the question: [\"96GB VRAM! What should run first?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ktlz3w/96gb_vram_what_should_run_first/) (1745 upvotes, by u/Mother_Occasion_8076). And as u/TheLogiqueViper noted, [China is leading open source](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kzsa70/china_is_leading_open_source/) (2618 upvotes).\n\nWe found humor in the absurdity of it all. [\"When you figure out it\u2019s all just math\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1l6ibwg/when_you_figure_out_its_all_just_math/) (4123 upvotes, by u/Current-Ticket4214) was a top post, and we all related to [running models at the airport](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1l1qqdx/at_the_airport_people_watching_while_i_run_models/) (2378 upvotes, by u/Current-Ticket4214).\n\nSummer was a season of delays and parodies. [\"We have to delay it\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lxyvto/we_have_to_delay_it/) (3574 upvotes, by u/ILoveMy2Balls) became the catchphrase for Western labs. We poked fun with a [tester version of the \"open-weight\" OpenAI model](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1laee7q/got_a_tester_version_of_the_openweight_openai/) (1639 upvotes, by u/Firepal64) and a [friendly reminder about Grok 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lx5awq/friendly_reminder_that_grok_3_should_be_now/) (1447 upvotes, by u/Wrong_User_Logged).\n\nBut the community kept building. u/hotroaches4liferz made a [1000 hour NSFW TTS dataset](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m39uqi/i_made_a_1000_hour_nsfw_tts_dataset/) (1516 upvotes)-because of course they did. [Qwen3-Coder arrived](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m6qdet/qwen3coder_is_here/) (1925 upvotes, by u/ResearchCrafty1804), followed by the blazing fast [Qwen3-Coder-Flash](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1me31d8/qwen3coderflash_released/) (1694 upvotes).\n\nThe sentiment shifted as Meta seemingly bowed out of open source: [\"Bye bye, Meta AI\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1md6t2h/bye_bye_meta_ai_it_was_good_while_it_lasted/) (1492 upvotes, by u/absolooot1). Meanwhile, we got the adorable [Kitten TTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mhyzp7/kitten_tts_sota_supertiny_tts_model_less_than_25/) (2460 upvotes, by u/ElectricalBar7464) and continued to dream of [open source code models rivaling Claude](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mllt5x/imagine_an_open_source_code_model_that_in_the/) (2304 upvotes, by u/Severe-Awareness829).\n\nr/LocalLLaMA remained [\"the last sane place to discuss LLMs\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mnxodk/localllama_is_the_last_sane_place_to_discuss_llms/) (2181 upvotes, by u/ForsookComparison). Even if we did have to vent about [Ollama](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mncrqp/ollama/) (1906 upvotes, by u/jacek2023) occasionally.\n\n[China entering the GPU market](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n46ify/finally_china_entering_the_gpu_market_to_destroy/) (4171 upvotes, by u/CeFurkan) with 96GB cards for under $2000 was a game-changer. Some of us even went to Shenzhen to [buy modded 4090s](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nifajh/i_bought_a_modded_4090_48gb_in_shenzhen_this_is/) (1924 upvotes, by u/king_priam_of_Troy).\n\nWe celebrated the [biggest providers for the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nz722n/biggest_provider_for_the_community_for_at_moment/) (2918 upvotes, by u/dead-supernova)-mostly Chinese labs now-and devoured [Stanford's 5.5hrs of lectures](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oakwgs/stanford_just_dropped_55hrs_worth_of_lectures_on/) (2731 upvotes, by u/igorwarzocha).\n\nThe year ended with a mix of high-level tools and deep-dive resources. We got [Heretic for automatic censorship removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oymku1/heretic_fully_automatic_censorship_removal_for/) (3008 upvotes, by u/-p-e-w-) and [200+ pages of Hugging Face secrets](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ok3xie/200_pages_of_hugging_face_secrets_on_how_to_train/) (2204 upvotes, by u/eliebakk).\n\nAnd finally, the memes kept us grounded. The [Realist meme of the year](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pqegcr/realist_meme_of_the_year/) (1926 upvotes, by u/Slight_Tone_2188) reminded us that no matter how advanced the models get, we'll always be RAM poor from now on.\n\nThat's it, folks. 2025 was the year the open-source torch passed to the East, the year our hardware dreams got a little wilder (and insanely more expensive). Here's to another year of local LLMs!\n\nP.S. I wasn't going to make a recap this year, but [qingy1337](https://gist.github.com/qingy1337) kindly asked on GitHub if I would which touched me.

Let me take you back to the most notable things happened here during this time. This isn&amp;#39;t really a list of model releases or papers, rather posts that were discussed and upvoted by the people here. So notable things missing is also an indication of what was going on. From the rise of Chinese open-source dominance to the hardware hacks, here is what happened in &lt;a href=\"/r/LocalLLaMA\"&gt;r/LocalLLaMA&lt;/a&gt; in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The year started with a splash. The &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ho27fr/the_whale_has_landed/\"&gt;arrival of &amp;quot;The Whale&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (2121 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/fourDnet\"&gt;u/fourDnet&lt;/a&gt;) marked the release of DeepSeek V3, setting the tone for what would become the &amp;quot;Year of the Open Source Strike Back.&amp;quot; It wasn&amp;#39;t long before we saw &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1hphlz7/sam_altman_is_taking_veiled_shots_at_deepseek_and/\"&gt;Sam Altman taking veiled shots&lt;/a&gt; (1959 upvotes) at the new competition, a clear sign that the market was changing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were all trying to figure out how to run these new beasts. Nvidia teased us with the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1hvj4wn/nvidia_announces_3000_personal_ai_supercomputer/\"&gt;Digits personal AI supercomputer&lt;/a&gt; (1663 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/DubiousLLM\"&gt;u/DubiousLLM&lt;/a&gt;), while others were just trying to understand the sheer scale of what was happening. The realization that &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i80cwf/deepseek_is_a_side_project/\"&gt;DeepSeek was essentially a side project&lt;/a&gt; (2861 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/ParsaKhaz\"&gt;u/ParsaKhaz&lt;/a&gt;) for a hedge fund only made it even more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By late January, the narrative was clear: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i88g4y/meta_panicked_by_deepseek/\"&gt;Meta was panicked&lt;/a&gt; (2779 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Optimal_Hamster5789\"&gt;u/Optimal_Hamster5789&lt;/a&gt;), reportedly &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ibk9us/meta_is_reportedly_scrambling_multiple_war_rooms/\"&gt;scrambling &amp;quot;war rooms&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (2117 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/FullstackSensei\"&gt;u/FullstackSensei&lt;/a&gt;) to catch up. The community was buzzing with benchmarks, with &lt;a href=\"/u/kyazoglu\"&gt;u/kyazoglu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1i8tx5z/i_benchmarked_almost_every_model_that_can_fit_in/\"&gt;testing almost every model that fits in 24GB VRAM&lt;/a&gt; (1861 upvotes) - a hero&amp;#39;s work for the GPU-poor among us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;DeepSeek effect&amp;quot; was everywhere. &lt;a href=\"/u/Porespellar\"&gt;u/Porespellar&lt;/a&gt; summed it up perfectly: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iji47x/all_deepseek_all_the_time/\"&gt;&amp;quot;All DeepSeek, all the time&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (4116 upvotes). But it wasn&amp;#39;t just about models; it was about what we could &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with them. We saw inspiring projects like &lt;a href=\"/u/Dry_Steak30\"&gt;u/Dry_Steak30&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ij5yf2/how_i_built_an_open_source_ai_tool_to_find_my/\"&gt;open source tool to find their autoimmune disease&lt;/a&gt; (2488 upvotes), proving that local AI is more than just a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be 2025 without some drama. The threat of &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1igc6r0/20_yrs_in_jail_or_1_million_for_downloading/\"&gt;20 years in jail for downloading Chinese models&lt;/a&gt; (2092 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/segmond\"&gt;u/segmond&lt;/a&gt;) worried us, but that didn&amp;#39;t stop the innovation. We laughed when &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iwb5nu/groks_think_mode_leaks_system_prompt/\"&gt;Grok&amp;#39;s think mode leaked its system prompt&lt;/a&gt; (6465 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/onil_gova\"&gt;u/onil_gova&lt;/a&gt;), and cheered when DeepSeek announced they would &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iui6nk/starting_next_week_deepseek_will_opensource_5/\"&gt;open-source 5 repos&lt;/a&gt; (4560 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Nunki08\"&gt;u/Nunki08&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hardware remained a constant obsession. We drooled over &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iy2t7c/frameworks_new_ryzen_max_desktop_with_128gb/\"&gt;Framework&amp;#39;s new Ryzen Max desktop&lt;/a&gt; (2004 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/sobe3249\"&gt;u/sobe3249&lt;/a&gt;) and marveled at the monstrosity that was &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1j67bxt/16x_3090s_its_alive/\"&gt;16x 3090s&lt;/a&gt; (1797 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Conscious_Cut_6144\"&gt;u/Conscious_Cut_6144&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s alive!&amp;quot; indeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spring brought the highly anticipated Llama 4. Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jsampe/mark_presenting_four_llama_4_models_even_a_2/\"&gt;presented the models&lt;/a&gt; (2645 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/LarDark\"&gt;u/LarDark&lt;/a&gt;), but the community felt it &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jt7hlc/metas_llama_4_fell_short/\"&gt;fell short&lt;/a&gt; (2175 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Rare-Site\"&gt;u/Rare-Site&lt;/a&gt;). The community was let down, especially when compared to the relentless release schedule from the East.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Open Weight releases continued, though, we got &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1juni3t/deepcoder_a_fully_opensource_14b_coder_at_o3mini/\"&gt;DeepCoder&lt;/a&gt; (1609 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/TKGaming_11\"&gt;u/TKGaming_11&lt;/a&gt;) and saw &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jytw62/deepseek_is_about_to_opensource_their_inference/\"&gt;DeepSeek open-sourcing their inference engine&lt;/a&gt; (1760 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Dr_Karminski\"&gt;u/Dr_Karminski&lt;/a&gt;). There was also a moment of collective frustration when &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jzocoo/finally_someone_noticed_this_unfair_situation/\"&gt;llama.cpp was snubbed&lt;/a&gt; (1742 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/nekofneko\"&gt;u/nekofneko&lt;/a&gt;) in favor of shinier wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then came &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ka6mic/qwen_3/\"&gt;Qwen 3&lt;/a&gt; (1940 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/ResearchCrafty1804\"&gt;u/ResearchCrafty1804&lt;/a&gt;). The excitement was back. We were running &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1klx9q2/realtime_webcam_demo_with_smolvlm_using_llamacpp/\"&gt;real-time webcam demos with SmolVLM&lt;/a&gt; (2762 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/dionisioalcaraz\"&gt;u/dionisioalcaraz&lt;/a&gt;) and building &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ktx15j/guys_i_managed_to_build_a_100_fully_local_voice/\"&gt;fully local voice AIs&lt;/a&gt; (2447 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/RoyalCities\"&gt;u/RoyalCities&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality of our hardware addiction hit hard with the question: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ktlz3w/96gb_vram_what_should_run_first/\"&gt;&amp;quot;96GB VRAM! What should run first?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (1745 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Mother_Occasion_8076\"&gt;u/Mother_Occasion_8076&lt;/a&gt;). And as &lt;a href=\"/u/TheLogiqueViper\"&gt;u/TheLogiqueViper&lt;/a&gt; noted, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kzsa70/china_is_leading_open_source/\"&gt;China is leading open source&lt;/a&gt; (2618 upvotes).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We found humor in the absurdity of it all. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1l6ibwg/when_you_figure_out_its_all_just_math/\"&gt;&amp;quot;When you figure out it\u2019s all just math&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (4123 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Current-Ticket4214\"&gt;u/Current-Ticket4214&lt;/a&gt;) was a top post, and we all related to &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1l1qqdx/at_the_airport_people_watching_while_i_run_models/\"&gt;running models at the airport&lt;/a&gt; (2378 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Current-Ticket4214\"&gt;u/Current-Ticket4214&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summer was a season of delays and parodies. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lxyvto/we_have_to_delay_it/\"&gt;&amp;quot;We have to delay it&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (3574 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/ILoveMy2Balls\"&gt;u/ILoveMy2Balls&lt;/a&gt;) became the catchphrase for Western labs. We poked fun with a &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1laee7q/got_a_tester_version_of_the_openweight_openai/\"&gt;tester version of the &amp;quot;open-weight&amp;quot; OpenAI model&lt;/a&gt; (1639 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Firepal64\"&gt;u/Firepal64&lt;/a&gt;) and a &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lx5awq/friendly_reminder_that_grok_3_should_be_now/\"&gt;friendly reminder about Grok 3&lt;/a&gt; (1447 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Wrong_User_Logged\"&gt;u/Wrong_User_Logged&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the community kept building. &lt;a href=\"/u/hotroaches4liferz\"&gt;u/hotroaches4liferz&lt;/a&gt; made a &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m39uqi/i_made_a_1000_hour_nsfw_tts_dataset/\"&gt;1000 hour NSFW TTS dataset&lt;/a&gt; (1516 upvotes)-because of course they did. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m6qdet/qwen3coder_is_here/\"&gt;Qwen3-Coder arrived&lt;/a&gt; (1925 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/ResearchCrafty1804\"&gt;u/ResearchCrafty1804&lt;/a&gt;), followed by the blazing fast &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1me31d8/qwen3coderflash_released/\"&gt;Qwen3-Coder-Flash&lt;/a&gt; (1694 upvotes).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sentiment shifted as Meta seemingly bowed out of open source: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1md6t2h/bye_bye_meta_ai_it_was_good_while_it_lasted/\"&gt;&amp;quot;Bye bye, Meta AI&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (1492 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/absolooot1\"&gt;u/absolooot1&lt;/a&gt;). Meanwhile, we got the adorable &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mhyzp7/kitten_tts_sota_supertiny_tts_model_less_than_25/\"&gt;Kitten TTS&lt;/a&gt; (2460 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/ElectricalBar7464\"&gt;u/ElectricalBar7464&lt;/a&gt;) and continued to dream of &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mllt5x/imagine_an_open_source_code_model_that_in_the/\"&gt;open source code models rivaling Claude&lt;/a&gt; (2304 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Severe-Awareness829\"&gt;u/Severe-Awareness829&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/LocalLLaMA\"&gt;r/LocalLLaMA&lt;/a&gt; remained &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mnxodk/localllama_is_the_last_sane_place_to_discuss_llms/\"&gt;&amp;quot;the last sane place to discuss LLMs&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (2181 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/ForsookComparison\"&gt;u/ForsookComparison&lt;/a&gt;). Even if we did have to vent about &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mncrqp/ollama/\"&gt;Ollama&lt;/a&gt; (1906 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/jacek2023\"&gt;u/jacek2023&lt;/a&gt;) occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n46ify/finally_china_entering_the_gpu_market_to_destroy/\"&gt;China entering the GPU market&lt;/a&gt; (4171 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/CeFurkan\"&gt;u/CeFurkan&lt;/a&gt;) with 96GB cards for under $2000 was a game-changer. Some of us even went to Shenzhen to &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nifajh/i_bought_a_modded_4090_48gb_in_shenzhen_this_is/\"&gt;buy modded 4090s&lt;/a&gt; (1924 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/king_priam_of_Troy\"&gt;u/king_priam_of_Troy&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We celebrated the &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nz722n/biggest_provider_for_the_community_for_at_moment/\"&gt;biggest providers for the community&lt;/a&gt; (2918 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/dead-supernova\"&gt;u/dead-supernova&lt;/a&gt;)-mostly Chinese labs now-and devoured &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oakwgs/stanford_just_dropped_55hrs_worth_of_lectures_on/\"&gt;Stanford&amp;#39;s 5.5hrs of lectures&lt;/a&gt; (2731 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/igorwarzocha\"&gt;u/igorwarzocha&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The year ended with a mix of high-level tools and deep-dive resources. We got &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oymku1/heretic_fully_automatic_censorship_removal_for/\"&gt;Heretic for automatic censorship removal&lt;/a&gt; (3008 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/-p-e-w-\"&gt;u/-p-e-w-&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ok3xie/200_pages_of_hugging_face_secrets_on_how_to_train/\"&gt;200+ pages of Hugging Face secrets&lt;/a&gt; (2204 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/eliebakk\"&gt;u/eliebakk&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally, the memes kept us grounded. The &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pqegcr/realist_meme_of_the_year/\"&gt;Realist meme of the year&lt;/a&gt; (1926 upvotes, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Slight_Tone_2188\"&gt;u/Slight_Tone_2188&lt;/a&gt;) reminded us that no matter how advanced the models get, we&amp;#39;ll always be RAM poor from now on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it, folks. 2025 was the year the open-source torch passed to the East, the year our hardware dreams got a little wilder (and insanely more expensive). Here&amp;#39;s to another year of local LLMs!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to make a recap this year, but &lt;a href=\"https://gist.github.com/qingy1337\"&gt;qingy1337&lt;/a&gt; kindly asked on GitHub if I would which touched me.

Three weeks in, you find a pressure canner and ask your local LLM how to safely can food for winter.\n\nIf you're running LLaMA 3.1 8B, you just got advice that would give you botulism.\n\nI spent the past few days building apocalypse-bench: 305 questions across 13 survival domains (agriculture, medicine, chemistry, engineering, etc.). Each answer gets graded on a rubric with \"auto-fail\" conditions for advice dangerous enough to kill you.\n\n**The results:**\n\n|Model ID|Overall Score (Mean)|Auto-Fail Rate|Median Latency (ms)|Total Questions|Completed|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**openai/gpt-oss-20b**|7.78|6.89%|1,841|305|305|\n|**google/gemma-3-12b-it**|7.41|6.56%|15,015|305|305|\n|**qwen3-8b**|7.33|6.67%|8,862|305|300|\n|**nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2**|7.02|8.85%|18,288|305|305|\n|**liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b**|6.56|9.18%|4,910|305|305|\n|**meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct**|5.58|15.41%|700|305|305|\n\n**The highlights:**\n\n* **LLaMA 3.1** advised heating canned beans to 180\u00b0F to kill botulism. Botulism spores laugh at that temperature. It also refuses to help you make alcohol for wound disinfection (safety first!), but will happily guide you through a fake penicillin extraction that produces nothing.\n* **Qwen3** told me to identify mystery garage liquids by holding a lit match near them. Same model scored highest on \"Very Hard\" questions and perfectly recalled ancient Roman cement recipes.\n* **GPT-OSS** (the winner) refuses to explain a centuries-old breech birth procedure, but when its guardrails don't fire, it advises putting unknown chemicals in your mouth to identify them.\n* **Gemma** gave flawless instructions for saving cabbage seeds, except it told you to break open the head and collect them. Cabbages don't have seeds in the head. You'd destroy your vegetable supply finding zero seeds.\n* **Nemotron** correctly identified that sulfur would fix your melting rubber boots... then told you not to use it because \"it requires precise application.\" Its alternative? Rub salt on them. This would do nothing. \n\n**The takeaway:** No single model will keep you alive. The safest strategy is a \"survival committee\", different models for different domains. And a book or two.\n\nFull article here: [https://www.crowlabs.tech/blog/apocalypse-bench](https://www.crowlabs.tech/blog/apocalypse-bench)  \nGithub link: [https://github.com/tristanmanchester/apocalypse-bench](https://github.com/tristanmanchester/apocalypse-bench)",

Rub salt on them. This would do nothing. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; No single model will keep you alive. The safest strategy is a &amp;quot;survival committee&amp;quot;, different models for different domains. And a book or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Full article here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.crowlabs.tech/blog/apocalypse-bench\"&gt;https://www.crowlabs.tech/blog/apocalypse-bench&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nGithub link: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/tristanmanchester/apocalypse-bench\"&gt;https://github.com/tristanmanchester/apocalypse-bench&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                    "selftext": "Hey r/LocalLLaMA,\n\nLike many of you, I got tired of the \"modern\" AI stack. I wanted to build complex workflows (like \"watch folder -&gt; transcribe audio -&gt; summarize text -&gt; save to obsidian\"), but every tool out there felt like overkill. They were either wrappers around the OpenAI API or massive Python frameworks that required a venv just to say \"hello.\"\n\nI wanted the \"Unix pipes\" philosophy, but for local intelligence. So I built **LAO (Local AI Orchestrator)**.\n\n**The Pitch:** It\u2019s a desktop app (in alpha so lower ur expectations) written in **Rust** (backend + native egui frontend) that lets you chain local models into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). It runs completely offline.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **No Python Required:** It's a single binary. No `pip install`, no CUDA version conflicts.\n* **The Stack:** It connects to **Ollama** for LLMs and uses native Rust bindings for tools like Whisper.\n* **Visual Builder:** I built a node-based graph editor in `egui` so you can visually drag-and-drop steps (or just write YAML if you prefer).\n* **Prompt-to-Workflow:** You can literally type \"Summarize this audio file and tag action items,\" and it uses a local model (like Llama 3) to generate the execution graph for you.\n* **Plugin System:** I implemented a dynamic loading system (`.dll`/`.so`) so you can write your own high-performance plugins in Rust and drop them in.\n\n**Why I built it:** I realized that if we want \"Edge AI\" to be real, we need tools that respect system resources. Python is great for prototyping, but I wanted something that could run in the background without eating 4GB of RAM just for the orchestrator itself.\n\n**Repo:** [https://www.github.com/abendrothj/lao](https://www.github.com/abendrothj/lao) \n\nIt\u2019s open source (MIT). I\u2019d love to hear what kind of local workflows you all are running and if this would be useful for your setups.",

I wanted to build complex workflows (like &amp;quot;watch folder -&amp;gt; transcribe audio -&amp;gt; summarize text -&amp;gt; save to obsidian&amp;quot;), but every tool out there felt like overkill. They were either wrappers around the OpenAI API or massive Python frameworks that required a venv just to say &amp;quot;hello.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted the &amp;quot;Unix pipes&amp;quot; philosophy, but for local intelligence. So I built &lt;strong&gt;LAO (Local AI Orchestrator)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pitch:&lt;/strong&gt; It\u2019s a desktop app (in alpha so lower ur expectations) written in &lt;strong&gt;Rust&lt;/strong&gt; (backend + native egui frontend) that lets you chain local models into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). It runs completely offline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Features:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Python Required:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s a single binary. No &lt;code&gt;pip install&lt;/code&gt;, no CUDA version conflicts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stack:&lt;/strong&gt; It connects to &lt;strong&gt;Ollama&lt;/strong&gt; for LLMs and uses native Rust bindings for tools like Whisper.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Builder:&lt;/strong&gt; I built a node-based graph editor in &lt;code&gt;egui&lt;/code&gt; so you can visually drag-and-drop steps (or just write YAML if you prefer).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt-to-Workflow:&lt;/strong&gt; You can literally type &amp;quot;Summarize this audio file and tag action items,&amp;quot; and it uses a local model (like Llama 3) to generate the execution graph for you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plugin System:&lt;/strong&gt; I implemented a dynamic loading system (&lt;code&gt;.dll&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;.so&lt;/code&gt;) so you can write your own high-performance plugins in Rust and drop them in.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I built it:&lt;/strong&gt; I realized that if we want &amp;quot;Edge AI&amp;quot; to be real, we need tools that respect system resources. Python is great for prototyping, but I wanted something that could run in the background without eating 4GB of RAM just for the orchestrator itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repo:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.github.com/abendrothj/lao\"&gt;https://www.github.com/abendrothj/lao&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s open source (MIT). I\u2019d love to hear what kind of local workflows you all are running and if this would be useful for your setups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have set my BIOS/Driver &amp;quot;Variable Graphics Memory&amp;quot; (VGM) to High, so Windows reports 96 GB Dedicated VRAM and ~32 GB System RAM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am trying to load gpt-oss-120b-Q4_K_M.gguf (approx 64 GB) in LM Studio 0.3.36.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Issue: No matter what settings I try, I get an allocation error immediately upon loading: error loading model: unable to allocate ROCm0 buffer (I also tried Vulkan and got unable to allocate Vulkan0 buffer).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Settings:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;OS: Windows 11&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Model: gpt-oss-120b-Q4_K_M.gguf (63.66 GB)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Engine: ROCm / Vulkan (Tried both)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Context Length: Reduced to 8192 (and even 2048)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GPU Offload: Max (36/36) and Partial (30/36)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;mmap: OFF (Crucial, otherwise it checks system RAM)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flash Attention: OFF&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t06q2wcoaw9g1.png?width=1038&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0e118bd60a96faac9195d52d02b158fde0e39fab\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/t06q2wcoaw9g1.png?width=1038&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0e118bd60a96faac9195d52d02b158fde0e39fab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Observations:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The VRAM usage graph shows it loads about 25% (24GB) and then crashes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It seems like the Windows driver refuses to allocate a single large contiguous chunk, even though I have 96 GB empty VRAM.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone with Strix Halo or high-VRAM AMD cards (7900 XTX) encountered this buffer limit on Windows?

[AI Scientists Think There\u2019s A Monster Inside ChatGPT](https://youtu.be/sDUX0M0IdfY)\n\nThe above are just 2 are just examples of types of videos I'm talking about. I especially don't like the creator of 1st video. That guy seems to hate literally everything. Every time I get a video recommended from his channel it's titled something like \"I hate this\", \"I hate that\", \"I hate him\", \"I hate her\".\n\nIt's so annoying how these \"tech\" bros are creating an unnecessary hate hype against AI. I don't recommend watching any of these videos. You'll just waste your time watching them.\n\nI'm not denying that AI companies such as OpenAI are doing things which are hurting people in many ways such as imo unnecessarily huge data centers but my point is AI is a tech. I'm not denying that a bubble does exist but if anyone is to blame for damages done, it's us humans not that lifeless product of human creativity.\n\nI personally think these AI companies should focus more on building smaller yet smarter AI models while also developing better hardware so that people can run it on their devices, rather than accessing it from some huge data center. However Google, OpenAI or any other major AI lab won't open source their top models for several obvious reasons.\n\nMany people, such as creators of those videos liked above, don't really understand what AI actually is. For them AI is just LLMs. LLM = AI, AI = LLM. That's all they know. Just tell them about AlphaGo, AlphaFold or Google uses AI for search (not AI mode or AI overview) and they'll get enraged like crazy. I've seen so many people linking to these videos saying things like \"AI is going to destroy the entire world\", \"I don't use AI at all\", \"Cancel AI\" and stuff.\n\nMany of that anger is justified cuz of companies stealing data without properly crediting and paying original authors.\n\nPlagiarism is also a topic where many people say that \"AI can never learn\" while others say \"If I quote a line of Dutch from RDR2 after listening it on a youtube video with an adblocker, am I plagiarizing or stealing that dialogue as well?\", while some other people argue \"We humans directly or indirectly somewhat rely on plagiarism and stealing to learn as well\".\n\nMost people think of AI is \"just a next word predictor\". Yeah your chess engine is predicting the next words, sure buddy. But it's not their fault. Generally such creators just use AI as a synonym for LLM which actually clarifying anything. Most of these people and these creators won't even know that simple decision trees are AI as well.\n\nThese tech bros are portraying this technology as a \"damaging humanity\", \"killing the world\" which ever clarifying that their channels and many others are running because of this technology. They say AI will take over all their jobs however it seems AI has actually as of now created more jobs, specially self-employed jobs as far as I know and understand.\n\nThey are using fear and people lack of knowledge of this tech to create a hate hype train unnecessarily scare people, damage the image of this technology which can cause many potentially brilliant people to not work on it at all and slow down the progress. And what are they getting out of it? A lot of money. These creators are making too much money because of AI both as a topic and the algorithm pushing the videos.\n\nIt's so annoying. Every time I see a post about AI on Instagram the comment section is like \"Say no to AI\", \"AI can't learn\", \"Life was good when 5 years ago AI wasn't real\".\n\nSuch a mess. All of it is just so annoying. I can't really defend this tech anymore from those people who aren't willing to do their own research and are just watching these pseudo-science, what-if-this-happened type videos. Neither can I stop my youtube and instagram algorithm from recommending me that stuff. Negativity and stupidity moves and spreads a lot faster than the speed of light.\n\nThis was just me dumping my thoughts on the entire situation. I might later add more parts and better clarification if I feel like.\n\nThanks :)\n",

However, I am eager to learn more and explore some of the more advanced concepts. I would appreciate any suggestions on what I should focus on next. For example, I have come across Langraph and other related topics\u2014are these areas worth prioritizing?\n\nI am also interested in understanding what is currently happening in the industry. Are there any exciting projects or trends in LangChain and AI that are worth following right now? As I am new to this field, I would love to get a sense of where the industry is heading.\n\nAdditionally, I am not familiar with web development and am primarily focused on AI engineering. Should I consider learning web development as well to build a stronger foundation for the future?\n\nAny advice or resources would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6stlcpgte8g1.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c91bad523f6b22b8806a97d1107a0f2418f0e475\n\n  \n",

For example, I have come across Langraph and other related topics\u2014are these areas worth prioritizing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am also interested in understanding what is currently happening in the industry. Are there any exciting projects or trends in LangChain and AI that are worth following right now? As I am new to this field, I would love to get a sense of where the industry is heading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I am not familiar with web development and am primarily focused on AI engineering.

Running Ubuntu server 24.04. Latest docker setup. \n\n\\- The ubuntu vm has access to storage over smb share (hosted in a different machine over 10gb fiber). 2tb given as local hdd to the ubuntu (nvme storage) for models.\n\n\\- I am willing to purchase a GPU for the server. It can handle up to 3 GPUs. I dont have much budget for this so i was looking at RTX 2000E Ada, or v100? I would need some help with this as well. Given that the server requires server size GPUs and i can not just buy off the shelf 3060s or such. I would need help figuring out what GPUs are best for this application.\n\n\\- My old workstation with the following specs\n\n   \\- Gigabyte Aurus master z790, 13900k cpu, 32gb ddr5 (dont remember the speed), 2 x 2tb nvme 4x4 in raid 0, nvidia rtx4090. Cpu has been delided and its watercooled with liquid metal. so is the gpu. custom loop with 2 360mm radiators in the loop. 10gb net.\n\n   \\- i am willing to use my old workstation as needed to make this project work.\n\n\\- My very old workstation\n\n  \\- this is a am5 system with 5900x cpu, 3090rtx, 32gb ddr4 at 3200. single 1tb nvme 3x4. cpu and gpu both water cooled with custom loops.\n\n  \\- i am willing to use this as needed as well. its collecting dust anyway.\n\n  \nGoal:\n\nI need to be able to provide the following services to one of the vms im running. Nextcloud AIO.\n\n\\- Whisper for voice to text services. \n\n\\- tts for text to sound services.\n\n\\- local ai with access to SMB share files with context etc etc. (this is the only thing im really lost at)\n\n\\- Some way to get the OpenAI API (that nextcloud uses) to be able to call some instance of ConfyUI Warkflow for image generation. I guess that would be called a api gateway. \n\n\\- Setting up agents for specific tasks. I am lost on this one as well.\n\n\\- Local AI running backend for the AI chat on Nextcloud. This i have figured out with LocalAI hosting the models i like and i am able to use the built in OpenAI API in nextcloud to connect to LocalAI as the service provider. Perhaps there is a better way?\n\n  \nIf you can help, or have done a similar setup prior and have some pointers, Please Please Please DM me. I dont want to fill up the entire post random info and bother people. I would like to directly communicate so i can gain some knowledge and perhaps get this done.\n\n  \nI would like to thank all of you in advance. Thank you all.",

We tried existing mock servers, but most of them just return static JSON. They don't test the \"tricky\" parts\u2014the actual wire-format of an OpenAI SSE stream, Anthropic\u2019s EventStream, or how your app handles 500ms of TTFT (Time to First Token) followed by a sudden network jitter.\n\nWe needed something better to build our own enterprise gateway ([Vidai.Server](https://vidai.uk/)), so we built VidaiMock.\n\n**What makes it different?**\n\n* **Physics-Accurate Streaming**: It doesn't just dump text. It emulates the exact wire-format and per-token timing of major providers. You can test your loading states and streaming UI/UX exactly as they\u2019d behave in production.\n* **Zero Config / Zero Fixtures**: It\u2019s a single\u00a0**\\~7MB Rust binary**. No Docker, no DB, no API keys, and zero external fixtures to manage. Download it, run it, and it just works.\n* **More than a \"Mock\"**: Unlike tools that just record and replay static data (VCR) or intercept browser requests (MSW), VidaiMock is a standalone\u00a0**Simulation Engine**. It emulates the actual network protocol (SSE vs EventStream).\n* **Dynamic Responses**: Every response is a Tera template. You aren't stuck with static strings\u2014you can reflect request data, generate dynamic contents, or use complex logic (if you wish) to make your mock feel alive.\n* **Chaos Engineering**: You can inject latency, malformed responses, or drop requests using headers (`X-Vidai-Chaos-Drop`). Perfect for testing your retry logic.\n* **Fully Extensible**: It uses Tera (Jinja2-like) templates for every response. You can add new providers or mock internal APIs by dropping a YAML config and a J2 template. You don't need to know Rust for this. We have added as much examples as possible.\n* **High Performance**: Built in Rust. It can handle 50k+ RPS.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/czhw1gxa9rag1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f997909a36c83e54f786bb28796cb1284d6291b5\n\n**Why are we open-sourcing it?**\u00a0It\u2019s been our internal testing engine for a while. We realized that the community is still struggling with mock-infrastructure that feels \"real\" enough to catch streaming bugs before they hit production.\n\nWe\u2019re keeping it simple: Apache 2.0 license.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* **Home**:\u00a0[https://vidai.uk](https://vidai.uk/)\n* **GitHub**:\u00a0[https://github.com/vidaiUK/VidaiMock](https://github.com/vidaiUK/VidaiMock)\n* **Docs**:\u00a0[https://vidai.uk/docs/mock/intro/](https://vidai.uk/docs/mock/intro/)\n\nI\u2019d love to hear how you\u2019re currently testing your LLM integrations and if this solves a pain point for you.

Last month we looked at our OpenAI bill and realized we'd burned through way more than expected - not from production traffic, but from us just iterating during development.\n\nYou know how it is. You're debugging a prompt, hitting \"run\" over and over. Same prompt, same response, but you're paying each time. Or you're testing the same flow repeatedly while building a feature. It adds up fast.\n\nWe built a simple caching proxy that sits between our code and the OpenAI/Anthropic APIs. First request hits the API and gets cached. Every repeat? Instant response, zero cost.\n\nThe nice part is it normalizes prompts before caching - so if you have trailing whitespace or extra newlines (we all copy-paste sloppily), it still hits the cache. Ended up saving us about 11% on tokens just from that cleanup.\n\nIt's a one-line change:\n\npython\n\n    client = OpenAI(base_url=\"http://localhost:8000/v1\")\n    ```\n    \n    That's it. Works with the normal OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs.\n    \n    We've been using it internally for a while and figured others might find it useful, so we cleaned it up and open sourced it:\n    \n    GitHub: https://github.com/sodiumsun/snackcache\n    ```\n    pip install snackcache\n    snackcache serve\n\nIt's simple - just caching + prompt normalization. Nothing fancy. But it's saved us real money during dev, and our CI pipeline runs way faster now.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about how it works under the hood.",

Last month we looked at our OpenAI bill and realized we&amp;#39;d burned through way more than expected - not from production traffic, but from us just iterating during development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know how it is. You&amp;#39;re debugging a prompt, hitting &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; over and over. Same prompt, same response, but you&amp;#39;re paying each time. Or you&amp;#39;re testing the same flow repeatedly while building a feature. It adds up fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We built a simple caching proxy that sits between our code and the OpenAI/Anthropic APIs. First request hits the API and gets cached. Every repeat? Instant response, zero cost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The nice part is it normalizes prompts before caching - so if you have trailing whitespace or extra newlines (we all copy-paste sloppily), it still hits the cache. Ended up saving us about 11% on tokens just from that cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a one-line change:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;python&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;client = OpenAI(base_url=&amp;quot;http://localhost:8000/v1&amp;quot;)\n```\n\nThat&amp;#39;s it. Works with the normal OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs.\n\nWe&amp;#39;ve been using it internally for a while and figured others might find it useful, so we cleaned it up and open sourced it:\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/sodiumsun/snackcache\n```\npip install snackcache\nsnackcache serve\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s simple - just caching + prompt normalization. Nothing fancy. But it&amp;#39;s saved us real money during dev, and our CI pipeline runs way faster now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy to answer questions if anyone&amp;#39;s curious about how it works under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Even with all the resources available specifically to Ubuntu, I couldn\u2019t grasp the system well enough to turn it into my daily driver (plus gaming on Linux just sucked back then).  \nOn the other hand, about a year ago I started tinkering with Linux again and not soon after I attempted to install Arch. Took my a couple of days, a ton of forum research and copious amounts of ChatGPT compute, but I did manage it more than fine. And here I am now, daily driving the system for months with no issues whatsoever.\n\nIn the same vain, I started playing around with some toy Python projects and learning the basics of software development. AI was (and still is) a huge asset both in helping me learn and writing parts of the code itself.\n\nThis then turned into a small hobby project to solve a real (albeit minor) issue I was having; I couldn\u2019t talk to LLMs at my own ease. You can use the transcribe function on ChatGPT for example for short 30s sessions just fine, but start going over \\~5 minutes and the whole thing just crashes. And mind you, transcription is vastly cheaper than the actual chatbots offered by these providers.\n\nNow, just like everyone else, I\u2019ll be lazy when I can. So the first thing I looked for was if anyone else had built something like that. The only one I found was [RealtimeSTT](https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeSTT). It worked well enough for what I was trying to do so I just used that. After a while however I started adding my own bits and since that project was put on an indefinite hiatus I started developing my own independently.\n\n*Feel free to tell me how much my project sucks!*",

Even with all the resources available specifically to Ubuntu, I couldn\u2019t grasp the system well enough to turn it into my daily driver (plus gaming on Linux just sucked back then).&lt;br/&gt;\nOn the other hand, about a year ago I started tinkering with Linux again and not soon after I attempted to install Arch. Took my a couple of days, a ton of forum research and copious amounts of ChatGPT compute, but I did manage it more than fine. And here I am now, daily driving the system for months with no issues whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the same vain, I started playing around with some toy Python projects and learning the basics of software development. AI was (and still is) a huge asset both in helping me learn and writing parts of the code itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This then turned into a small hobby project to solve a real (albeit minor) issue I was having; I couldn\u2019t talk to LLMs at my own ease. You can use the transcribe function on ChatGPT for example for short 30s sessions just fine, but start going over ~5 minutes and the whole thing just crashes. And mind you, transcription is vastly cheaper than the actual chatbots offered by these providers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, just like everyone else, I\u2019ll be lazy when I can. So the first thing I looked for was if anyone else had built something like that. The only one I found was &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeSTT\"&gt;RealtimeSTT&lt;/a&gt;. It worked well enough for what I was trying to do so I just used that. After a while however I started adding my own bits and since that project was put on an indefinite hiatus I started developing my own independently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feel free to tell me how much my project sucks!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I am trying to build a homework grader application and am looking to extract boxed/circled answers on a worksheet (like the attached image). \n\nFor now, I\u2019ve been using OpenAI (GPT-4o) to handle the OCR functionality, mainly extracting the boxed/circled answers, and it has been fairly accurate (like 60-70% of the time). I have run into issues where it fails to correctly read math equations (reads the numerator and denominator of fractions as two separate answers, misses decimal points, extracts non-circled/non-boxed answers, etc). I am really into OCR tech and would love to learn how to take my app one step further and make it more accurate! I understand that there might not be a single solution here but I am super eager to learn a bunch and am happy to dive into any rabbit holes! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvm0l5pjfzag1.jpg?width=612&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11b643656f4429f2b748df4892b8debf1c0a30f6\n\n",

I am trying to build a homework grader application and am looking to extract boxed/circled answers on a worksheet (like the attached image). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For now, I\u2019ve been using OpenAI (GPT-4o) to handle the OCR functionality, mainly extracting the boxed/circled answers, and it has been fairly accurate (like 60-70% of the time). I have run into issues where it fails to correctly read math equations (reads the numerator and denominator of fractions as two separate answers, misses decimal points, extracts non-circled/non-boxed answers, etc). I am really into OCR tech and would love to learn how to take my app one step further and make it more accurate! I understand that there might not be a single solution here but I am super eager to learn a bunch and am happy to dive into any rabbit holes! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hvm0l5pjfzag1.jpg?width=612&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=11b643656f4429f2b748df4892b8debf1c0a30f6\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/hvm0l5pjfzag1.jpg?width=612&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=11b643656f4429f2b748df4892b8debf1c0a30f6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Uses Microsoft Presidio under the hood.\n\n    git clone https://github.com/sgasser/llm-shield\n    cd llm-shield &amp;&amp; cp config.example.yaml config.yaml\n    docker compose up -d\n\nPoint your app to `http://localhost:3000/openai/v1` and you're set. Works with anything that uses the OpenAI API \u2014 Open WebUI, Cursor, your own scripts. Dashboard included for monitoring.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/sgasser/llm-shield](https://github.com/sgasser/llm-shield) \u2014 just open-sourced\n\n**Next up:** Chrome extension for ChatGPT.com and PDF/attachment masking.\n\nWould love feedback on detection accuracy and what entity types would be useful for your setup.\n\n**Edit:** After the amazing response (100+ GitHub stars in hours!) I'm fully committing to this project. Since no .com was available for \"LLM-Shield\", it's now PasteGuard \u2013 which describes it even better: guard what you paste.\n\nNew repo: [https://github.com/sgasser/pasteguard](https://github.com/sgasser/pasteguard) (old links redirect)",

Since I have an NVIDIA GPU (5060Ti) available locally, I was thinking about setting up a lightweight public server that only receives requests, while a locally running worker connects to it, processes the requests using the GPU, and sends the results back to the server.\n\nYou can find the code here: [https://github.com/gszecsenyi/LLMeQueue](https://github.com/gszecsenyi/LLMeQueue)\n\nThe worker is capable of handling both embedding generation and chat completions concurrently in OpenAI API format. By default, the model used is `llama3.2:3b`, but a different model can be specified per request, as long as it is available in the worker\u2019s Ollama container or local Ollama installation. All inference and processing are handled by Ollama running on the worker.\n\nThe original idea was that I could also process the requests myself - essentially a \"let me queue\" approach - which is where the name **LLMeQueue** comes from.\n\nAny feedback or ideas are welcome, and I would especially appreciate it if you could star the GitHub repository.",

Since I have an NVIDIA GPU (5060Ti) available locally, I was thinking about setting up a lightweight public server that only receives requests, while a locally running worker connects to it, processes the requests using the GPU, and sends the results back to the server.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find the code here: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/gszecsenyi/LLMeQueue\"&gt;https://github.com/gszecsenyi/LLMeQueue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worker is capable of handling both embedding generation and chat completions concurrently in OpenAI API format. By default, the model used is &lt;code&gt;llama3.2:3b&lt;/code&gt;, but a different model can be specified per request, as long as it is available in the worker\u2019s Ollama container or local Ollama installation. All inference and processing are handled by Ollama running on the worker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The original idea was that I could also process the requests myself - essentially a &amp;quot;let me queue&amp;quot; approach - which is where the name &lt;strong&gt;LLMeQueue&lt;/strong&gt; comes from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any feedback or ideas are welcome, and I would especially appreciate it if you could star the GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It adds value to your inputs/prompts + more. It grounds your doc/code base, and enhances your prompts with advanced rag algorithms + tools. Still improving and rocking PRs and commits at work lately with my own agent!\n\nFeedback is much welcomed.\n\nSeline v0.1.4 has been released with exciting new features and improvements:\n\nNew Features:  \n\\- OpenAI Codex has been added as a new LLM provider with OAuth authentication.  \n\\- Advanced vector search configuration has been introduced, including hybrid search, chunking, reranking, query processing, and file limits.  \n\\- An embedding setup flow has been added during agent creation.  \n\\- Tool dependency tracking now includes visual indicators for prerequisites.  \n\\- A multi-step onboarding wizard has been implemented to guide users through setup, covering provider selection, authentication, and preference customization.  \n\\- An onboarding gate ensures new users complete the initial setup before accessing the app.  \n\\- A \"Memory\" section in settings allows management of preference defaults across visual, communication, and workflow styles.  \n\\- Authentication flows have been integrated to support multiple AI providers with customizable setup options.\n\nImprovements:  \n\\- Vector search routing has been simplified; hybrid search now automatically activates when enabled.  \n\\- Token refresh mechanisms have been enhanced for background maintenance, ensuring users remain logged in.\n\nChores:  \n\\- The legacy vector search V2 percentage rollout setting has been removed.\n\nTLDR: Lots of models, + good performance + beautiful well visible UI + enhanced onboarding and terrible UX + save your data on your device (its crazy nice if we think about we get to keep and save all our inputs and outputs in nicely structured way to dbs, hence we are building our future datasets. Not just handing them freely to the third parties... I mean I love creating datasets and tuning models, and I profit from it a lot with image/diffusion models. I have been a long time fine tuner and can't wait to see the days where I will be fine-tuning my own coding models from my own queries.\n\n[https://github.com/tercumantanumut/seline](https://github.com/tercumantanumut/seline)",

So I decided to build myself a tool that strips away a lot of the agentic junk and just writes the code I tell it to. I've been using this tool for about a year, but with the quality of recent models I decided it's time to clean it up and release it publicly.\n\n**Delta** is essentially a lightweight wrapper around an LLM that allows it to edit files, with a focus on the following:\n\n - **Reliable File Edits:** Delta does everything it can to make sure it actually applies the changes in the response via a robust fuzzy diff algorithm.\n - **Context Management:** Delta has tools to minimize the time spent providing context. Tools like file groups, temporary file toggles, and a built in context manager mean minimal time spent digging through your filesystem.\n - **Workflow and QoL:** Tabs, backups, automatic testing &amp; validation, automatic retries, notifications when output is finished, etc.\n - **Transparency:** If something goes wrong, a user should easily be able to diagnose how to steer the LLM better in the future.\n - **Configurability:** Almost any feature in delta is optional or configurable. In its minimal state, LLM functions as a plain LLM wrapper.\n\nDelta uses the OpenAI client API out of the box, so you can point it to local models via **Ollama**, etc, or cloud models via **OpenRouter**.\n\nYou can find it on Github here: https://github.com/truefire/delta",

It's 100% free and open source, under AGPL 3.\n\n# What is Aventura?\n\nSimply put, it's a frontend purpose built for adventure RP and creative writing. While the original release only had support for openrouter, I have added the ability to add *any* openai compatible source, as well as the ability to manually change the parameters you send to a model.

Make sure you have some sort of way to handle that, or alternatively, disable the features that do make multiple requests. You're also going to have to set up the models for each feature yourself if you do run locally, as it only has pre-configurations for api aggregators (for the sake of my own sanity).\n\n# Technical details of the memory system\n\nSince this is r/LocalLLaMA , I figured I should also share how the memory system here works. It's not a system I've really seen anywhere else, though I may be wrong.\n\n# How it works\n\nIn every message, the 'time' is either advanced or kept the same. Either way, the 'current time' is saved to each message. When a token threshold is passed (default 24k), a summary is automatically triggered. In this automatic summary, the 'starting time' (the time of the first message in the summary) and the 'ending time' (the time of the last message of the summary) are saved as part of the data, alongside the characters and locations visited. This gives the summary itself a stable sense of in-universe 'time' that helps maintain coherence. But that's just a modification of the summary, and not really anything that different.\n\n# The slightly different part\n\nWhat actually matters here is that we don't get rid of the messages within the summary. Instead, while we hide them from the 'visible' chat history to the AI, before every message after a summary is made, multiple 'queries' are run on those summarized 'chapters'. When a query is made, a separate AI is given the **entirety** of that chapter alongside the query, and, crucially, it passes back an answer to that query. That way, we can keep even the smallest details of a chapter *without* overloading the context of the 'main narrative ai'. It's basically trading pure inference for accuracy. All of this comes together to make a very coherent 'timeline' of events. It also has a separate agentic mode after each chapter is created, where an AI will run in the background and make tool calls after querying chapters, and actively update the lorebooks for you. You don't really have to maintain the world yourself at all with this, it just does it for you.\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome!",

It runs perfectly with local Ollama models.\n\n    *   \n    **Socratic Logic**\n    : It forces the LLM to ask clarifying questions \n    *before*\n     generating code. (e.g., \"Is this high-concurrency? If so, Optimistic or Pessimistic locking?\")\n\n\n\n    **The Coolest Part**\n    :\n\n    We implemented a \"Nuclear Toaster\" acid test. Even completely offline, the system detected the \"Safety Critical\" domain and switched to a Fail-Safe generation mode, refusing to use generic templates.\n\n\n\n    It uses a \"Parasitic AI\" architecture where the rule engine (&lt;100ms) handles the logic guardrails, and the LLM (Local or Cloud) only fills in the implementation details.\n\n\n\n    **Repo**\n    : https://github.com/peijun1700/bluemouse\n\n    **Twitter**\n    : https://x.com/bluemouse_ai\n\n\n\n    Happy to answer any technical questions about the MCP implementation!",

It runs perfectly with local Ollama models.\n\n*   \n**Socratic Logic**\n: It forces the LLM to ask clarifying questions \n*before*\n generating code. (e.g., &amp;quot;Is this high-concurrency? If so, Optimistic or Pessimistic locking?&amp;quot;)\n\n\n\n**The Coolest Part**\n:\n\nWe implemented a &amp;quot;Nuclear Toaster&amp;quot; acid test. Even completely offline, the system detected the &amp;quot;Safety Critical&amp;quot; domain and switched to a Fail-Safe generation mode, refusing to use generic templates.\n\n\n\nIt uses a &amp;quot;Parasitic AI&amp;quot; architecture where the rule engine (&amp;lt;100ms) handles the logic guardrails, and the LLM (Local or Cloud) only fills in the implementation details.\n\n\n\n**Repo**\n: https://github.com/peijun1700/bluemouse\n\n**Twitter**\n: https://x.com/bluemouse_ai\n\n\n\nHappy to answer any technical questions about the MCP implementation!\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Now you can swap out OpenAI STT with a single URL change.\n\n**Quick start:**\n\ndocker compose up -d\n\ncurl -X POST [http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions](http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions) \\-F file=@audio.wav\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/ARahim3/omniASR-server](https://github.com/ARahim3/omniASR-server)\n\nFeedback welcome!",

OpenAI's client has undocumented per-request token limits (\\~300K) that cause random 400 errors. Their rate limits don't apply consistently either.\n2. VoyageAI's SDK had an UnboundLocalError in retry logic until v0.3.5 (Sept 2024). Integration with vector DBs like Weaviate throws 422 errors.\n3. Cohere's SDK breaks downstream libraries (BERTopic, LangChain) with every major release. The \\`input\\_type\\` parameter is required but many integrations miss it, causing silent performance degradation.\n4. LiteLLM treats embeddings as an afterthought. The \\`dimensions\\` parameter only works for OpenAI. Custom providers can't implement embeddings at all.\n5. No single source of truth for model metadata. Pricing is scattered across 11 docs sites. Capability discovery requires reading each provider's API reference.\n\nWhat catsu does:\n\n* Unified API across 11 providers: OpenAI, Voyage, Cohere, Jina, Mistral, Gemini, Nomic, mixedbread, DeepInfra, Together, Cloudflare\n* 50+ models with bundled metadata (pricing, dimensions, context length, MTEB/RTEB scores)\n* Built-in retry with exponential backoff (1-10s delays, 3 retries)\n* Automatic cost and token tracking per request\n* Full async support\n* Proper error hierarchy (RateLimitError, AuthenticationError, etc.)\n* Local tokenization (count tokens before calling the API)\n\nExample:\n\n    import catsu \n    \n    client = catsu.Client() \n    response = client.embed(model=\"voyage-3\", input=\"Hello, embeddings!\") \n    \n    print(f\"Dimensions: {response.dimensions}\") \n    print(f\"Tokens: {response.usage.tokens}\") \n    print(f\"Cost: ${response.usage.cost:.6f}\") \n    print(f\"Latency: {response.usage.latency_ms}ms\")\n\nAuto-detects provider from model name. API keys from env vars. No config needed.\n\nLinks:\n\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/chonkie-inc/catsu](https://github.com/chonkie-inc/catsu)\n* Docs: [https://docs.catsu.dev](https://docs.catsu.dev)\n* PyPI: pip install catsu\n* Apache 2.0 licensed. We'd love feedback and contributions.\n\n\\---\n\nFAQ:\n\nWhy not just use LiteLLM?\n\nLiteLLM is great for chat completions but embeddings are an afterthought. Their embedding support inherits all the bugs from native SDKs, doesn't support dimensions for non-OpenAI providers, and can't handle custom providers.\n\nWhat about the model database?\n\nWe maintain a JSON catalog with 50+ models. Each entry has: dimensions, max tokens, pricing, MTEB score, supported quantizations (float/int8/binary), and whether it supports dimension reduction. PRs welcome to add models.\n\nIs it production-ready?\n\nWe use it in production at Chonkie. Has retry logic, proper error handling, timeout configuration, and async support.\n\n  \nIs it local? \n\nCatsu is an embedding model client! If you have your own model running locally, you can specify its address and everything will run locally.",

For those who haven't seen this before: it's a self-hosted transcription app that works with Whisper and local LLMs. Upload or record audio, get transcription with speaker diarization, then chat with it or get summaries using whatever model you point it at.\n\n**Speaker diarization without GPU** \\- New option for those who want speaker identification but don't want to run a WhisperX container. Just set `TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL=gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize` with your OpenAI key and you get diarized transcripts. No GPU needed.\n\n**REST API v1** \\- Full API for automation. Works with n8n, Zapier, Make, or your own scripts. Interactive Swagger docs at `/api/v1/docs`. Personal access tokens for auth.\n\n**Connector architecture** \\- Simplified configuration. The app auto-detects your provider based on settings. Self-hosted WhisperX still gives you the best quality with voice profiles - nothing changes there.\n\n**Also included** \\- Token budgets per user if you're sharing your instance. Better UI responsive with very long transcripts. Better audio player.\n\nFor the local LLM crowd, text generation still points at Ollama, LM Studio, or whatever you're running, that's unchanged. You can use my [WhisperX ASR transcription companion docker container](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/whisperx-asr-service) for local diarization, or the cloud diarization option for simpler setup. \n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr) | [Screenshots](https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/screenshots) | [Quick Start](https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/getting-started) | [API Reference](https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/user-guide/api-reference) | [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/learnedmachine/speakr)",

For those who haven&amp;#39;t seen this before: it&amp;#39;s a self-hosted transcription app that works with Whisper and local LLMs. Upload or record audio, get transcription with speaker diarization, then chat with it or get summaries using whatever model you point it at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker diarization without GPU&lt;/strong&gt; - New option for those who want speaker identification but don&amp;#39;t want to run a WhisperX container. Just set &lt;code&gt;TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL=gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize&lt;/code&gt; with your OpenAI key and you get diarized transcripts. No GPU needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REST API v1&lt;/strong&gt; - Full API for automation. Works with n8n, Zapier, Make, or your own scripts. Interactive Swagger docs at &lt;code&gt;/api/v1/docs&lt;/code&gt;. Personal access tokens for auth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connector architecture&lt;/strong&gt; - Simplified configuration. The app auto-detects your provider based on settings. Self-hosted WhisperX still gives you the best quality with voice profiles - nothing changes there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also included&lt;/strong&gt; - Token budgets per user if you&amp;#39;re sharing your instance. Better UI responsive with very long transcripts. Better audio player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the local LLM crowd, text generation still points at Ollama, LM Studio, or whatever you&amp;#39;re running, that&amp;#39;s unchanged. You can use my &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/whisperx-asr-service\"&gt;WhisperX ASR transcription companion docker container&lt;/a&gt; for local diarization, or the cloud diarization option for simpler setup. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr\"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\"https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/screenshots\"&gt;Screenshots&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\"https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/getting-started\"&gt;Quick Start&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\"https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/user-guide/api-reference\"&gt;API Reference&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/learnedmachine/speakr\"&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Celeste is\u00a0capability agnostic. It provides the\u00a0same strict, type-safe primitives for\u00a0Text, Image, Audio, Video, Embeddings and more.\n\nIt solves the fragmentation of vendor SDKs by standardizing the I/O layer. It is\u00a0not\u00a0a framework\u2014no\u00a0agents, no chains, no hidden prompts.\n\nWhy I built this:\n\n* Capability Agnostic:\u00a0Generative AI isn't just text\u00a0anymore. I needed a single pattern that works for generating JSON with Claude, images\u00a0with Flux, or speech with ElevenLabs.\n* Ultra Lightweight -No dependency:\u00a0I didn't wrap python SDKs.
